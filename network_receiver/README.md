## Network receiver example
This example acts as an root node and it can receive messages from other nodes in a network with the same credentials. For example other nodes running the `network_sender` example.

Only one root node can be part of a network.

### How to build
To build the example, in this directory run:
```
make TARGET=<target>
```
The example assumes that libmira is placed in vendor/, to specify another path run:
```
make LIBDIR=<path-to-libmira> TARGET=<target>
```

To flash after building, add `flashall` or `flash.<programmer serial number>` to the make command:
```
make TARGET=<target> flashall
``````
or
```
make LIBDIR=<path-to-libmira> TARGET=<target> flashall
```
